        <p>After several iterations and attempts to create the taste I am looking for in a hot sauce I found solace in simplicity. I call it Bazooka Luca's 80/20-Mix.
          <br><br>
          Would you like to give it a try yourself?<br>Here is my recipe:
          <br><br>
          80% Habaneros, 20% CarolinaReapers, no seeds, no pith, 20% brine, ferment for two weeks, mix and process in a mouli-l√©gumes, 80% chili mix + 20% white wine vinegar.
          <br><br>
          Enjoy!
